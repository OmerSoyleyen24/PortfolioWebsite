              I am Ömer Söyleyen, 21 years old, and I am from Eskişehir. I am currently a final-year student in
              Computer Engineering at Konya Technical University. I have been actively working in the web
              development field for over two years. Throughout this time, I have participated in various projects,
              and
              I am currently focused on developing projects using the MERN stack.
              In the future, I hope to become a computer engineer who creates innovative and effective solutions
              by utilizing my knowledge and experience in this field. My goal is to be one of the best in web
              development and to make a significant impact in my career.
