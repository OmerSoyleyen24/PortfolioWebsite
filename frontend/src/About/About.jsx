I am Ömer Söyleyen, a 23-year-old computer engineer from Eskişehir, Türkiye. I have recently graduated from the Computer Engineering program at Konya Technical University. I have been actively working in the field of web development for over two years, during which I have contributed to and developed various projects, with a strong focus on the MERN stack.

My graduation thesis was centered on cryptocurrency systems, where I explored AI-driven approaches to leverage data analysis, mitigate financial risks, and ensure system reliability and security. This experience strengthened my interest in combining artificial intelligence with modern web technologies.

I am passionate about building scalable, efficient, and secure web applications, and my long-term goal is to become a highly skilled engineer who delivers innovative and impactful solutions. I aim to continuously improve my expertise in web development and AI-integrated systems, and to make a meaningful contribution to the tech industry.
